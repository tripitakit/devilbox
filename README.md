The setup is as follows:
A box (or chamber) is divided into two parts by a wall with a small door or trapdoor.
The box is filled with particles at a uniform temperature. In your version, the particles are described as red and blue, 50% / 50%.
The player operates the door.
The goal of the player is to separate the particles based on their property (color):

The player opens and closes the door to allow only red particles to pass to one side and only blue particles to the other.
The result is a sorted box, with all red particles on one side and all blue particles on the other.

The increase in entropy caused by the player's own actions (energy consumption and information processing) always exceeds the decrease in entropy from sorting the particles, thus preserving the second law of thermodynamics.
